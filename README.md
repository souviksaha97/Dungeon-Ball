# Dungeon Ball

A simple game designed using Pygame on Python 3.8.5, inspired by a whole generation of 8-bit games.


# Rules

 * Use the arrow keys to move the paddle left and right to hit the ball.
 * You level up every five hits. As the level goes up, the speed of the ball and the paddle increases.
 * Aim to keep the ball from falling into the gutter down below.
