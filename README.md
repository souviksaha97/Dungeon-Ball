# Rules

 * Use the arrow keys to move the paddle left and right to hit the ball.
 * You level up every five hits. As the level goes up, the speed of the ball and the paddle increases.
 * Aim to keep the ball from falling into the gutter down below.
 * Collect the powerup to lengthen the paddle for 30 seconds.
